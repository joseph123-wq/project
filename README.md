## JOKE VIEWER APPLICATION
This is an application that is used to display random jokes when the user presses the button.
This app is made to provide people with entertainment wgenever they need it.
This app functions in a way that it fetches data from an online api and then the data is updated to the DOM and displayed to the user.

## Architecture
As seen on the javascript code, data is fetched from the API and then the code displays it on the screen.
The user is then presented with a comment button for him/her to add a comment.
After the comments, the user is given a button to generate a new joke.

## sources 
The api is hosted at:`https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/random`
